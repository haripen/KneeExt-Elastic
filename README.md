# KneeExt-Elastic
A simple Hill-type leg-press simulation for a concentric knee extension in Matlab

This is an upgrade to the KneeExt simulation (https://github.com/haripen/KneeExt) which adds length dependencies, serial- and parallel elastic elements to the previous model consisting of activation dynamics, force-velocity relation and a geometrical relatrion.

The model was developed during my dissertation which is available an ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331022620_The_effect_of_fatigue_on_identified_human_neuromuscular_parameters?_sg=BNKbuuRJLLgRZmKNu-z6yhsGkPmiRjIMTSN24I33oBByhZtHETC9izwlNlh6VWDLC-XjphHwdM0mFshlfLtkltsEzlUuyaPaO31RwERd.GhxlPHaifOkYiphbj6BLqfBAFVA9MzgBKgeAqSYPidEex19RyOQn77mzpNreYvwh1qy2TSBwPaa7IQC4Cf_kQg)
